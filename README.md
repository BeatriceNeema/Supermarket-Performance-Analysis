- Food & beverages product line generated more sales compared to the other product lines therefore widening this product line collection could peak customer's curiosity and increase sales also making more lucrative offers on the existing products occasionally should increase the gross income.
- Branch C accumulated more ratings in the highest rate range of 8–10 indicating high customer shopping satisfaction within this branches, therefore contributing to the high revenue generation, thus the tactics and strategies used by the employees in this branch should be used across all the other branches to increase customer satisfaction and retention and possibly increase revenue.

Overall, the branches have the capacity to generate more revenue as seen by the small marginal difference in their revenues so it is important to note that any strategy implemented in one branch should be revised and implemented in the other branches for maximum outcome.
